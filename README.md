# DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization

Welcome to the **DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization** repository! This repository contains all my coursework, assignments, and projects completed during the TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization program offered by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera.

## Instructors
- **Laurence Moroney**
- **Eddy Shyu**

## Overview

### Course 1: Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow
This is the first course of the TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization.

**Week 1: Functional API**
- Compare Functional and Sequential APIs
- Discover new models you can build with the Functional API
- Build a model that produces multiple outputs including a Siamese network

**Week 2: Custom Loss Functions**
- Build custom loss functions (including the contrastive loss function used in a Siamese network)
- Measure how well a model is doing and help your neural network learn from training data

**Week 3: Custom Layers**
- Create custom layers for your models
- Customize a network layer with a lambda layer
- Understand what makes up a custom layer and explore activation functions

**Week 4: Custom Models**
- Add custom functionality to existing models
- Define your own custom class instead of using the Functional or Sequential APIs
- Build models that can be inherited from the TensorFlow Model class
- Build a residual network (ResNet) through defining a custom model class

**Bonus: Callbacks**
- Customize your model outputs and its behavior during training through custom callbacks
- Implement a custom callback to stop training once overfitting is detected
- Use a model checkpoint to save parameters during training
- Use the EarlyStopping callback to prevent overfitting

### Course 2: Custom and Distributed Training with TensorFlow
This is the second course of the TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization.

**Week 1: Differentiation and Gradients**
- Learn about Tensor objects, the fundamental building blocks of TensorFlow
- Understand the difference between the eager and graph modes in TensorFlow
- Use a TensorFlow tool to calculate gradients

**Week 2: Custom Training**
- Build custom training loops using GradientTape and TensorFlow Datasets for more flexibility and visibility with model training

**Week 3: Graph Mode**
- Learn about the benefits of generating code that runs in graph mode
- Practice generating this more efficient code automatically with TensorFlowâ€™s tools

**Week 4: Distributed Training**
- Harness the power of distributed training to process more data and train larger models faster
- Get an overview of various distributed training strategies
- Practice training on multiple GPU cores and TPU cores

### Course 3: Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow
This is the third course of the TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization.

**Week 1: Introduction to Computer Vision**
- Explore image classification, image segmentation, object localization, and object detection
- Apply transfer learning to object localization and detection

**Week 2: Object Detection**
- Apply object detection models such as regional-CNN and ResNet-50
- Customize existing models and build your own models to detect, localize, and label images

**Week 3: Image Segmentation**
- Implement image segmentation using variations of the fully convolutional network (FCN) including U-Net and Mask-RCNN

**Week 4: Visualization and Interpretation**
- Identify which parts of an image are being used by your model to make predictions using class activation maps and saliency maps
- Apply these ML interpretation methods to inspect and improve the design of a famous network, AlexNet

### Course 4: Generative Deep Learning with TensorFlow
This is the fourth course of the TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialization.

**In this course, you will:**
- Learn neural style transfer using transfer learning to combine the content of an image with the style of a painting
- Build simple AutoEncoders on the MNIST dataset and more complex architectures on the Fashion MNIST dataset
- Explore Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to generate new data and generate anime faces
- Learn about GANs, their properties, and architecture, and build your own GAN to generate faces
